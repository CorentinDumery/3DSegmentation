# 3DTransformation
## Evaluation of a Spectral Data Transformation Method for Meaningful Mesh Segmentation

Disclaimer: the objective of this study is not the development of an efficient 3D Segmentation method, but instead the evaluation of a data transformation method prior to segmentation. For 3D Segmentation repositories, see [this page](https://github.com/topics/3d-segmentation).
